Several years ago, I watched a video that kick-started my interest in satellite communications. It was none other than [The Thought Emporium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGWFg7EDnyY). I collected hardware over the years according to [this other guide](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-com-goes-16-17-and-gk-2a-weather-satellite-reception-comprehensive-tutorial/), and made a few fruitless attempts at receiving data from [GOES 16](https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/geostationary-operational-environmental-satellite-16). But after finding success with HRPT signals, it was time to try again.

A review of the hardware used:
 * 2.4 GHz wifi grid antenna
 * 2.5 cm spacer for the reflector
 * SDR (I used [SMArTee](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/smart/nesdr-smartee-xtr-sdr.html))
 * LNA/Filter (I used [SawBird GOES+](https://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-addons/sawbird/sawbird-plus-goes.html))
 * USB extension
 * Laptop running [SatDump](https://www.satdump.org/)
 * Phone running [Look4Sat](https://github.com/rt-bishop/Look4Sat)

A photo of the 2.5cm spacer I built to modify the grid antenna's frequency from 2.4GHz to 1.7GHz.

And a photo of a completely professional radio telescope lab. Note that the antenna's feed is converted to SMA, then run through the lna/filter and directly into the SDR as closely as possible to prevent losses. From there the USB cable extends to the laptop. The USB port provides enough power for both the SDR as well as the lna/filter through Bias-T.

SatDump configuration:
 * frequency: 1.6941 GHz
 * decimation: 1
 * samplerate: 2.56 Mbps
 * turn on automatic gain control
 * the bias T is automatically enabled in this SDR's hardware, but you can enable the checkbox.

After turning on the SDR open processing, select "GOES-R HRIT", and click start.

After finding the general direction and skew for the antenna, the aim can be fine tuned by observing the Demodulator graph (bottom left in the following image). The better your reception, the more the dots group into two circles. The signal to noise ratio could definitely use some improvement but this was good enough to scrape some almost-complete data.

Luckily, the signal provides a description of the ensuing data:

```
The GOES-16 HRIT/EMWIN East broadcast utilizes virtual channels for the transmission of
several simultaneous data streams. The table below identifies the current
virtual channels assignments.

Along with the main sensor data, the stream also includes a bunch of additional data and maps. The South-Eastern USA was considered a priority when this scan took place:

I'm not sure how the schedule works, but sometimes you can also grab images that are relayed from other satellites around the world. A few examples:

After running the experiment for several hours, there was a wind-related mishap (stay tuned for another post). But for the time I scanned, I was able to pick up several transmissions. It's a little glitchy and scaled down, but here's an animation of the false colour images:

![Filming Earth](/assets/images/hrit_001/abi_rgb_GEO_False_Color.gif)
If you look near the centre, you can see the reflection of the sun.

And an animation of the mid-level troposphere water vapour:
